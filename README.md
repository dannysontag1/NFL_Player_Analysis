## INTRODUCTION

With the recent advancement of data availability, over the past decade there has been a major uptick in synergy between analytics and sports. It has become big business with many companies capitalizing on the power that data can bring to an organization. Pro Football Focus (www.pff.com) has become a staple in the NFL analytics community proudly stating that in 2019 it was utilized by all 32 NFL teams. I will apply Pro Football Focus data from the last 10 years to predict the age of maximum performance across six vastly different positions in the NFL - Quarterback, Running Back, Tackle, Cornerback, Linebacker and Defensive End. In a salary capped league, determining the future value of players during contract negotiations is crucial in building a top caliber team. Additionally, I will be looking at alma mater of top tiered players to see if certain universities are producing NFL caliber players at a higher rate. Lastly, I look at height and weight of the players to determine if these quantifiable figures are a key indicator of success during the draft process.
